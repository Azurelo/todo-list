# Overview

This is a simple web-based To-Do List application built using using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can keep track of tasks by adding them to their list, checking tasks as complete, and deleting them from their list when finished. 

My goal for this To-Do List application was to solidify my knowledge of JavaScript by focusing on manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) and handling user input effectively and having a clean UI with HTML/CSS.

4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.

# Development Environment

- **Text Editor**: Visual Studio Code for writing and editing code.
- **Browser**: Google Chrome for testing the application and using developer tools for debugging.
- **Programming Language**: Vanilla JavaScript to use event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic user interface design.
